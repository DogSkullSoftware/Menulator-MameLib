  <Header name="Configuration Options">
    <Field name="readconfig" type="boolean" default="1">
      <description xml:space="preserve">Enables or disables the reading of the config files. When enabled (which is the default), MAME reads the following config files in order: 
	- mame.ini
	- &lt;mymame&gt;.ini (i.e. if MAME was renamed mame060.exe, MAME parses mame060.ini here)
	- mamed.ini  (if this is a debug build, i.e. mamed.exe)
	- vector.ini (for vector games only)
	- &lt;driver&gt;.ini (based on the source filename of the driver)
	- &lt;parent&gt;.ini (for clones only, may be called recursively)
	- &lt;gamename&gt;.ini
The settings in the later ini's override those in the earlier ini's. So, for example, if you wanted to disable overlay effects in the vector games, you can create a vector.ini with the "effect none" line in it, and it will override whatever effect value you have in your mame.ini. The default is ON (-readconfig).</description>

		</Field>
		<Field name="playback" type="file" ext=".inp">
			<description>Specifies a file from which to play back a series of game inputs. This feature does not work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch a previously recorded game session from start to finish. In order to make things consistent, you should only record and playback with all configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The default is NULL (no playback).</description>
      <alt>pb</alt>
    </Field>
		<Field name="record" type="file" ext=".inp">
			<description>Specifies a file to record all input from a game session. This can be used to record a game session for later playback. This feature does not work reliably for all games, but can be used to watch a previously recorded game session from start to finish. In order to make things consistent, you should only record and playback with all configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory card files deleted. The default is NULL (no recording).</description>
      <alt>rec</alt>
		</Field>
    <Field name="snapname" type="string">
      <description>Describes how MAME should name files for snapshots. &lt;name&gt; is a string	that provides a template that is used to generate a filename. Three	simple substitutions are provided: the / character represents the	path separator on any target platform (even Windows); the string %g	represents the driver name of the current game; and the string %i	represents an incrementing index. If %i is omitted, then each	snapshot taken will overwrite the previous one; otherwise, MAME will	find the next empty value for %i and use that for a filename. The	default is %g/%i, which creates a separate folder for each game, and names the snapshots under it starting with 0000 and increasing from there.</description>
    </Field>
    <Field name="snapsize" type="string" default="auto">
      <description>Hard-codes the size for snapshots and movie recording. By default, MAME will create snapshots at the game's current resolution in raw pixels, and will create movies at the game's starting resolution in raw pixels. If you specify this option, then MAME will create both snapshots and movies at the size specified, and will bilinear filter the result. Note that this size does not automatically rotate if the game is vertically oriented. The default is 'auto'.</description>
    </Field>
    <Field name="snapview" type="string" default="internal">
      <description>Specifies the view to use when rendering snapshots and movies. By default, both use a special 'internal' view, which renders a separate snapshot per screen or renders movies only of the first screen. By specifying this option, you can override this default behavior and select a single view that will apply to all snapshots and movies. Note that &lt;viewname&gt; does not need to be a perfect match; rather, it will select the first view whose name matches all the characters specified by &lt;viewname&gt;. For example, -snapview native will match the "Native (15:14)" view even though it is not a perfect match. &lt;viewname&gt; can also be 'auto', which selects the first view with all screens present. The default value is 'internal'.</description>
    </Field>
		<Field name="mngwrite" type="file" ext=".mng">
			<description>Writes each video frame to the given &lt;filename&gt; in MNG format, producing an animation of the game session. Note that -mngwrite only writes video frames; it does not save any audio data. Use -wavwrite for that, and reassemble the audio/video using offline tools. The default is NULL (no recording).</description>
		</Field>
    <Field name="aviwrite" type="file" ext=".avi">
      <description>Stream video and sound data to the given &lt;filename&gt; in AVI format, producing an animation of the game session complete with sound. The default is NULL (no recording).</description>
    </Field>
		<Field name="wavwrite" type="file" ext=".wav">
			<description>Writes the final mixer output to the given &lt;filename&gt; in WAV format, producing an audio recording of the game session. The default is NULL (no recording).</description>
		</Field>
    <Field name="burnin" type="boolean" default="0">
      <description>Tracks brightness of the screen during play and at the end of emulation generates a PNG that can be used to simulate burn-in effects on other games. The resulting PNG is created such that the least used-areas of the screen are fully white (since burned-in areas are darker, all other areas of the screen must be lightened a touch). The intention is that this PNG can be loaded via an artwork file with a low alpha (e.g, 0.1-0.2 seems to work well) and blended over the entire screen. The PNG files are saved in the snap directory under the gamename/burnin-&lt;screen.name&gt;.png. The default is OFF (-noburnin).</description>

	<Header name="Core Performance Options">
		<Field name="autoframeskip" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the game, adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the game running at full speed. Turning this on overrides the value you have set for -frameskip below. The default is OFF (-noautoframeskip).</description>
      <alt>afs</alt>
    </Field>
		<Field name="frameskip" type="int" min="0" max="12" default="0">
			<description>Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of frames out of every 12 to drop when running. For example, if you say -frameskip 2, then MAME will display 10 out of every 12 frames. By skipping those frames, you may be able to get full speed in a game that requires more horsepower than your computer has. The default value is -frameskip 0, which skips no frames.</description>
      <alt>fs</alt>
    </Field>
		<Field name="seconds_to_run" type="int" default="0">
			<description>This option can be used for benchmarking and automated testing. It tells MAME to stop execution after a fixed number of seconds. By combining this with a fixed set of other command line options, you can set up a consistent environment for benchmarking MAME performance. In addition, upon exit, the -str option will write a screenshot called final.png to the game's snapshot directory.</description>
      <alt>str</alt>
    </Field>
		<Field name="throttle" type="boolean" default="1">
			<description>Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on, MAME attempts to keep the game running at the game's intended speed. When throttling is off, MAME runs the game as fast as it can. Note that the fastest speed is more often than not limited by your graphics card, especially for older games. The default is ON (-throttle).</description>
		</Field>
		<Field name="sleep" type="boolean" default="1">
			<description>Allows MAME to give time back to the system when running with -throttle. This allows other programs to have some CPU time, assuming that the game isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources. This option can potentially cause hiccups in performance if other demanding programs are running. The default is ON (-sleep).</description>	
		</Field>
    <Field name="speed" type="float" min="0.01" max="2.00" default="1.00">
      <description>Changes the way MAME throttles gameplay such that the game runs at some multiplier of the original speed. A &lt;factor&gt; of 1.0 means to run the game at its normal speed. A &lt;factor&gt; of 0.5 means run at half speed, and a &lt;factor&gt; of 2.0 means run at 2x speed. Note that changing this value affects sound playback as well, which will scale in pitch	accordingly. The internal resolution of the fraction is two decimal	places, so a value of 1.002 is the same as 1.0. The default is 1.0.</description>
    </Field>
    <Field name="refreshspeed" type="boolean" default="0">
      <description>Allows MAME to dynamically adjust the gameplay speed such that it does not exceed the slowest refresh rate for any targeted monitors in your system. Thus, if you have a 60Hz monitor and run a game that is actually designed to run at 60.6Hz, MAME will dynamically change the speed down to 99% in order to prevent sound hiccups or other undesirable side effects of running at a slower refresh rate. The default is OFF (-norefreshspeed).</description>

	<Header name="Core Rotation Options">
		<Field name="rotate" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Rotate the game to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical). This ensures that both vertically and horizontally oriented games show up correctly without the need to rotate your monitor. If you want to keep the game displaying 'raw' on the screen the way it would have in the arcade, turn this option OFF. The default is ON (-rotate).</description>	
		</Field>
		<Field name="ror" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Rotate the game screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise) relative to either its normal state (if -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is specified). The default for both of these options is OFF (-noror -norol).</description>	
		</Field>
		<Field name="rol" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Rotate the game screen to the right (clockwise) or left (counter-clockwise) relative to either its normal state (if -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is specified). The default for both of these options is OFF (-noror -norol).</description>	
		</Field>
		<Field name="autoror" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>These options are designed for use with pivoting screens that only pivot in a single direction. If your screen only pivots clockwise, use -autorol to ensure that the game will fill the screen either horizontally or vertically in one of the directions you can handle. If your screen only pivots counter-clockwise, use -autoror.</description>

	</Header>
	<Header name="Core Artwork Options">
		<Field name="artwork_crop" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Enable cropping of artwork to the game screen area only. This works best with -video gdi or -video d3d, and means that vertically oriented games running full screen can display their artwork to the left and right sides of the screen. This does not work with -video ddraw because of the way the game screens are rendered and scaled after the fact. This option can also be controlled via the Video Options menu in the user interface. The default is OFF (-noartwork_crop).</description>

		<Field name="contrast" type="float" min="0.1" max="2" default="1.0">
			<description>Controls the contrast, or white level, of the game screens. This option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MAME UI, you can individually set the contrast for each game screen; this option controls the initial value for all visible game screens. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer display, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a more saturated display. The default is 1.0.</description>	
		</Field>
		<Field name="gamma" type="float" min="0.1" max="3" default="1.0">
			<description>Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to white ramp, for the game screens. This option does not affect the artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MAME UI, you can individually set the gamma for each game screen; this option controls the initial value for all visible game screens. The standard value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will increase the nonlinearity toward black, while selecting higher values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity toward white. The default is 1.0.</description>

        <description>Controls whether or not MAME looks for a mouse controller to use. Note that in many cases, lightguns are treated as mice by the operating system, so you may need to enable this to enable lightgun support. When this is enabled, you will not be able to use your mouse in Windows while playing a game. If you want to get control of your computer back, you will need to either pause the game or quit.

        <description xml:space="preserve">Controls how joystick values map to digital joystick controls. MAME accepts all joystick input from the system as analog data. For true analog joysticks, this needs to be mapped down to the usual 4-way or 8-way digital joystick values. To do this, MAME divides the analog range into a 9x9 grid. It then takes the joystick axis position (for X and Y axes only), maps it to this grid, and then looks up a translation from a joystick map. This parameter allows you to specify the map. The default is 'auto', which means that a standard 8-way, 4-way, or 4-way diagonal map is selected automatically based on the input port configuration of the current game.
        Maps are defined as a string of numbers and characters. Since the grid is 9x9, there are a total of 81 characters necessary to define a complete map. Below is an example map for an 8-way joystick:
        777888999    Note that the numeric digits correspond to the keys
        777888999    on a numeric keypad. So '7' maps to up+left, '4' maps
        777888999    to left, '5' maps to neutral, etc. In addition to the
        444555666    numeric values, you can specify the character 's',
        444555666    which means "sticky". In this case, the value of the
        444555666    map is the same as it was the last time a non-sticky
        111222333    value was read.
        111222333
        111222333

        To specify the map for this parameter, you can specify a string of rows separated by a '.' (which indicates the end of a row), like so:
        777888999.777888999.777888999.444555666.444555666.444555666.111222333.111222333.111222333

        However, this can be reduced using several shorthands supported by the &lt;map&gt; parameter. If information about a row is missing, then it is assumed that any missing data in columns 5-9 are left/right symmetric with data in columns 0-4; and any missing data in colums 0-4 is assumed to be copies of the previous data. The same logic applies to missing rows, except that up/down symmetry is assumed. By using these shorthands, the 81 character map can be simply specified by this 11 character string: 7778...4445 
        
        Looking at the first row, 7778 is only 4 characters long. The 5th entry can't use symmetry, so it is assumed to be equal to the previous character '8'. The 6th character is left/right symmetric with the 4th character, giving an '8'. The 7th character is left/right symmetric with the 3rd character, giving a '9' (which is '7' with left/right flipped). Eventually this gives the full 777888999 string of the row. The second and third rows are missing, so they are assumed to be identical to the first row. The fourth row decodes similarly to the first row, producing 444555666. The fifth row is missing so it is assumed to be the same as the fourth. The remaining three rows are also missing, so they are assumed to be the up/down mirrors of the first three rows, giving three final rows of 111222333.

        <description>If you play with an analog joystick, the center can drift a little. joy_deadzone tells how far along an axis you must move before the axis starts to change. This option expects a float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. Where 0 is the center of the joystick and 1 is the outer limit. The default is 0.3. This is handled through DirectX and will override your driver settings. So if your joystick driver has it's own deadzone settings you may want to use -joy_deadzone 0 to disable the feature.</description>

      <Field name="digital" type="string" default="none">
        <description xml:space="preserve">Controls which joystick axes are considered digital. If MAME knows that a given joystick axis is digital, it can make much better decisions about how to treat that axis. If you are using a digital gamepad with MAME, you will want to use this option. There are a number of ways to do this:
    -digital all means that all axes of all connected joysticks will be treated as digital.
    -digital none means that all axes of all connected joysticks will be treated as analog (this is the default behavior).
    -digital j2 will treat all axes of joystick #2 as digital; axes on all other joysticks will be treated as analog.
    -digital j1a0a1 will treat axis 0 and 1 on joystick #1 as digital; all other axes will be treated as analog.
    -digital j1a0a1,j2a5 will treat axis 0 and 1 on joystick #1 as digital, as well as axis 5 on joystick #2; all other axes will be treated as analog.

Make use of the information provided by -verbose to determine which joysticks and axes you should be configuring this way. The default is 'none'.

			<description>Specifies which video subsystem to use for drawing. By specifying 'gdi' here, you tell MAME to render video using standard Windows graphics drawing calls. This is the slowest but most compatible option. Specifying 'ddraw' instructs MAME to use DirectDraw for rendering. This causes MAME to render everything at a lower resolution and then upscale the results at the end. This produces high performance, especially on older or low-power video cards, but has a noticeably lower output quality. Specifying 'd3d' tells MAME to use Direct3D for rendering. This produces the highest quality output and enables all rendering options. It is recommended if you have a recent (2002+) video card. The final option 'none' displays no windows and does no drawing. This is primarily present for doing CPU benchmarks without the overhead of the video system. The default is d3d.</description>

When running in a window with this option on, you can only resize the window to the proper aspect ratio, unless you are holding down the CONTROL key. By turning the option off, the aspect ratio is allowed to float. In full screen mode, this means that all games will stretch to the full screen size (even vertical games). In window mode, it means that you can freely resize the window without any constraints. The default is ON (-keepaspect).</description>

		<Field name="prescale" type="int" min="1" default="1">
			<description>Controls the size of the screen images when they are passed off to the graphics system for scaling. At the minimum setting of 1, the screen is rendered at its original resolution before being scaled. At higher settings, the screen is expanded by a factor of &lt;amount&gt; before being scaled. With -video ddraw or -video d3d, this produces a less blurry image at the expense of some speed. In -video ddraw mode, this also increases the effective resolution of non-screen elements such as artwork and fonts. The default is 1.</description>
		</Field>
		<Field name="effect" type="file" default="none">
			<description>Specifies a single PNG file that is used as an overlay over any game screens in the video display. This PNG file is assumed to live in the root of one of the artpath directories. The pattern in the PNG file is repeated both horizontally and vertically to cover the entire game screen areas (but not any external artwork), and is rendered at the target resolution of the game image. For -video gdi and -video d3d modes, this means that one pixel in the PNG will map to one pixel on your output display. For -video ddraw, this means that one pixel in the PNG will map to one pixel in the prescaled game screen. If you wish to use an effect that requires mapping n PNG pixels to each game screen pixel with -video ddraw, you need to specify a -prescale factor of n as well. The RGB values of each pixel in the PNG are multiplied against the RGB values of the target screen. The default is 'none', meaning no effect.</description>

    <Field name="waitvsync" type="boolean" default="0">
      <description>Waits for the refresh period on your computer's monitor to finish before starting to draw video to your screen. If this option is off, MAME will just draw to the screen at any old time, even in the middle of a refresh cycle. This can cause "tearing" artifacts, where the top portion of the screen is out of sync with the bottom portion. Tearing is not noticeable on all games, and some people hate it more than others. However, if you turn this option on, you will waste more of your CPU cycles waiting for the proper time to draw, so you will see a performance hit. You should only need to turn this on in windowed mode. In full screen mode, it is only needed if -triplebuffer does not remove the tearing, in which case you should use -notriplebuffer -waitvsync. Note that this option does not work with -video gdi mode. The default is OFF (-nowaitvsync).</description>

		<Field name="syncrefresh" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Enables speed throttling only to the refresh of your monitor. This means that the game's actual refresh rate is ignored; however, the sound code still attempts to keep up with the game's original refresh rate, so you may encounter sound problems. This option is intended mainly for those who have tweaked their video card's settings to provide carefully matched refresh rate options.

In addition, if you have configured specific arcade-like video modes for MAME and don't want MAME to perform any non-integral scaling of the image, you should also disable this option.

			<description>Specifies the physical aspect ratio of the physical monitor for each window. In order to use multiple windows, you must have increased the value of the -numscreens option. The physical aspect ratio can be determined by measuring the width and height of the visible screen image and specifying them separated by a colon. The default value for these options is 'auto', which means that MAME assumes the aspect ratio is proportional to the number of pixels in the desktop video mode for each monitor.

		<Field name="resolution1" type="resolutionlist" default="auto">
			<description>Specifies an exact resolution to run in. In full screen mode, MAME will try to use the specific resolution you request. The width and height are required; the refresh rate is optional. If omitted or set to 0, MAME will determine the mode auomatically. For example, -resolution 640x480 will force 640x480 resolution, but MAME is free to choose the refresh rate. Similarly, -resolution 0x0@60 will force a 60Hz refresh rate, but allows MAME to choose the resolution. The string "auto" is also supported, and is equivalent to 0x0@0. In window mode, this resolution is used as a maximum size for the window. This option requires the -switchres option as well in order to actually enable resolution switching with -video ddraw or -video d3d. The default value for these options is 'auto'.

		<Field name="triplebuffer" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Enables or disables "triple buffering". Normally, MAME just draws directly to the screen, without any fancy buffering. But with this option enabled, MAME creates three buffers to draw to, and cycles between them in order. It attempts to keep things flowing such that one buffer is currently displayed, the second buffer is waiting to be displayed, and the third buffer is being drawn to. -triplebuffer will override -waitvsync, if the buffer is sucessfully created. This option does not work with -video gdi. The default is OFF (-notriplebuffer).</description>

		<Field name="switchres" type="boolean" default="0">
			<description>Enables resolution switching. This option is required for the -resolution* options to switch resolutions in full screen mode. On modern video cards, there is little reason to switch resolutions unless you are trying to achieve the "exact" pixel resolutions of the original games, which requires significant tweaking. This option is also useful on LCD displays, since they run with a fixed resolution and switching resolutions on them is just silly. This option does not work with -video gdi. The default is OFF (-noswitchres).</description>

		<Field name="full_screen_brightness" type="float" min="0.1" max="2" default="1.0">
			<description>Controls the brightness, or black level, of the entire display. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a darkened display, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a brighter display. Note that not all video cards have hardware to support this option. This option does not work with -video gdi. The default is 1.0.</description>

			<description>Controls the contrast, or white level, of the entire display. The standard value is 1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer display, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a more saturated display.

			<description>Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black to white ramp, for the entire display. The standard value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp from black to white. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will increase the nonlinearity toward black, while selecting higher values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity toward white. Note that not all video cards have hardware to support this option. This option does not work with -video gdi. The default is 1.0.</description >

		<Field name="audio_latency" type="int" min="1" max="4" default="1">
			<description>This controls the amount of latency built into the audio streaming. By default MAME tries to keep the DirectSound audio buffer between 1/5 and 2/5 full. On some systems, this is pushing it too close to the edge, and you get poor sound sometimes. The latency parameter controls the lower threshold. The default is 1 (meaning lower=1/5 and upper=2/5). Set it to 2 (-audio_latency 2) to keep the sound buffer between 2/5 and 3/5 full. If you crank it up to 4, you can definitely notice the lag.</description>

This option is a hack for supporting older dual lightgun setups. If you have multiple lightguns connected, you will probably just need to enable -mouse and configure each lightgun independently.
